# Tetris-game-on-Proteus

Here, we will describe how to design a ***10X8 Tetris game*** without using any microcontroller. We will just use basic ICs of flip-flpos, counter, Mux and logic gates. We will simulate our circuit on ***proteus***(a digital circuit simualtor).
This problem statement is of ***Digisim 2020*** event, Digisim is a Digital Electronics based event where participants must design optimized digital systems and simulate them on Proteus. The problem statements include exhilarating real-world applications ranging from ***implementing classical Algorithms*** to ***interactive Game controllers*** using the fundamental building blocks of digital electronics. It is an event of ***UDYAM*** the annual Technical Fest of ***Department of ELECTRONICS IIT(BHU)***.
